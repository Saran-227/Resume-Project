# Resume-Project
ğŸŒŸ Excited to share my first-semester final project! ğŸŒŸ

I created MakeMyResume, a resume generator that simplifies the process of creating professional resumes. By taking user inputs, the tool arranges the information into a polished, professional format.

This project has been an incredible learning experience, and I would love to hear your thoughts and feedback on it. ğŸš€

Your suggestions would mean a lot as I continue to grow and refine my skills in this journey. ğŸ˜Š
